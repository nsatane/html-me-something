            <h2>Miami: City of Beaches</h2>
            <p>Miami Beach is a south Florida island city, connected by bridges to mainland Miami.
             Wide beaches stretch from North Shore Open Space Park, past palm-lined Lummus Park to 
             South Pointe Park. The southern end, South Beach, is known for its international cachet
             with models and celebrities, and its early-20th-century architecture in the Art Deco 
             Historic district with pastel-colored buildings, especially on Ocean Drive</p>
